# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

Our project and community are dedicated to providing a welcoming and inspiring
experience for everyone. All contributors are expected to follow this Code of
Conduct to help ensure a positive environment.

Key points:

- Be respectful and considerate in all communications.
- Avoid discriminatory, harassing, or abusive language or behavior.
- Respect privacy and personal boundaries; do not post others' private
  information.
- If you witness or experience unacceptable behavior, report it to the
  maintainers (see SECURITY.md for contact details).

Maintainers will respond to reports and may take action at their discretion,
including removal of offending content or banning of contributors to protect
the community.
